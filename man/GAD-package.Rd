\title{GAD: Analysis of Variance from General Principles}
\description{
Analysis of complex ANOVA models with any combination of orthogonal/nested and fixed/random factors, as described by Underwood (1997). There are two restrictions: (i) data must be balanced; (ii) fixed nested factors are not allowed. Homogeneity of variances is checked using Cochran's C test and 'a posteriori' comparisons of means are done using Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) procedure. For those terms with no denominator in the F-ratio calculation, pooled mean squares and quasi F-ratios are provided. Magnitute of effects are assessed by components of variation.
